# FinSight

AI-powered personal finance assistant. Upload financial documents (bank
statements, receipts, CSV exports), ask questions about your finances in a
chat interface, and see an at-a-glance dashboard of income, spending, and
savings — all backed by a retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) pipeline over
your own documents.

This is a pnpm monorepo with a TypeScript frontend/API layer and an
independent Python RAG backend.

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4, TanStack Query, `sonner` toasts, `react-dropzone` uploads, `next-themes` for light/dark mode.
- **API server**: Express 5, owns all `/api/*` routes in the deployed environment.
- **RAG backend**: a standalone Python service pair — `rag-pipeline` (ingestion/search library) and `rag-api` (FastAPI HTTP wrapper + Claude-powered answer synthesis) — with its own Supabase project and Python dependencies, decoupled from the rest of the monorepo.
- **Dashboard data** (income/spending/savings summary and activity feed) is still served from an in-memory mock store; documents and chat are wired to the real RAG backend.

See [`replit.md`](./replit.md) for the day-to-day architecture-decisions log kept alongside this codebase.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** and **pnpm** (this repo enforces pnpm via a `preinstall` guard — `npm install` will fail on purpose)
- **Python 3.11+** with `venv`, only if you're working on `services/rag-pipeline` or `services/rag-api`
- A **Supabase** project with the `pgvector` extension (for the RAG backend) — see [`services/rag-pipeline/README.md`](./services/rag-pipeline/README.md)
- API keys: **OpenAI** (embeddings) and **Anthropic** (chat answer synthesis) — only needed if you're running the RAG backend against live services rather than mocks

## Quick start

Frontend + mock dashboard data only (no Python backend needed):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/finsight run dev     # http://localhost:23970 (or $PORT)
```

Full stack, including real document upload/chat via the RAG backend:

```bash
# 1. Install JS/TS dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Set up the RAG backend (see services/rag-pipeline/README.md for Supabase setup)
cd services/rag-pipeline && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .
cd ../rag-api && pip install -e ../rag-pipeline -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env   # fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, INTERNAL_API_KEY
uvicorn rag_api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 3. Point the frontend at it
cd ../../artifacts/finsight
cp .env.example .env.local   # RAG_API_BASE_URL + RAG_API_INTERNAL_KEY (must match rag-api's INTERNAL_API_KEY)

# 4. Run the frontend (and, optionally, the Express API server)
pnpm --filter @workspace/finsight run dev
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev
```

## Environment variables

| App | File | Key variables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artifacts/finsight` | `.env.local` (gitignored, copy from `.env.example`) | `RAG_API_BASE_URL`, `RAG_API_INTERNAL_KEY` |
| `services/rag-api` | `.env` (gitignored, copy from `.env.example`) | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `INTERNAL_API_KEY` |
| `services/rag-pipeline` | `.env` (gitignored, copy from `.env.example`) | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

`RAG_API_INTERNAL_KEY` (frontend) and `INTERNAL_API_KEY` (rag-api) must be the
same value — it's a shared secret sent as the `X-Internal-Api-Key` header on
every server-to-server request. The RAG API is never called directly from
the browser.

## Common commands

Run from the repository root unless noted:

```bash
pnpm install                                       # install all workspace packages
pnpm run typecheck                                 # typecheck every package in the workspace
pnpm run build                                      # typecheck + build every package
pnpm --filter @workspace/finsight run dev           # frontend, http://localhost:$PORT
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev         # Express API server, port 8080
pnpm --filter @workspace/mockup-sandbox run dev     # Vite UI sandbox for mockups
```

Python services (from within `services/rag-pipeline` or `services/rag-api`,
inside their respective virtualenv):

```bash
pytest                                              # rag-api and rag-pipeline test suites
python scripts/test_ingest_and_query.py             # rag-pipeline end-to-end sanity check (needs real credentials)
uvicorn rag_api.main:app --reload --port 8000       # run rag-api locally
```

## API routes

All under `/api`, served by the Express `api-server` in the deployed
environment (mirrored in Next.js route handlers — see the `pnpm-workspace`
Claude Code skill for why both exist and must be kept in sync):

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/documents` | List uploaded documents |
| `POST` | `/api/documents` | Upload a document (`multipart/form-data`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/documents/:id` | Delete a document |
| `GET` | `/api/chat/messages` | Chat history |
| `POST` | `/api/chat/messages` | Send a message (returns user + assistant messages) |
| `GET` | `/api/dashboard/summary` | Income/spending/savings totals + category breakdown (mock data) |
| `GET` | `/api/dashboard/activity` | Recent transactions list (mock data) |

Document and chat routes proxy server-side to the RAG backend
(`services/rag-api`); see its [endpoint table](./services/rag-api/README.md#endpoints)
for what happens behind that proxy.

## Testing

- **RAG pipeline / RAG API**: `pytest` in each service's virtualenv — all
  tests mock external calls (Supabase, OpenAI, Anthropic), so no live
  credentials are needed to run the suite.
- **Frontend / API server**: no automated test suite yet — `pnpm run
  typecheck` across the workspace is the current safety net, backed up by
  manual verification in a running dev server.
- Live end-to-end testing against real Supabase/OpenAI/Anthropic credentials
  and the actual AWS deployment have not been run in this environment — see
  [`BACKLOG.md`](./BACKLOG.md) for exactly what's verified vs. what still
  needs real credentials.

## Deployment status

- The frontend and API server run locally; no live production deployment
  exists yet.
- AWS deployment artifacts for `rag-api` (ECS Fargate + CDK) are built and
  ready but have **not** been applied — no AWS credentials in this
  development environment. See
  [`services/rag-api/DEPLOYMENT.md`](./services/rag-api/DEPLOYMENT.md) for
  the manual deployment steps.
